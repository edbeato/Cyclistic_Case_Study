### Scenario

I am a data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

In order to do this effectively and efficiently I followed the six phases of the data analysis process.

## 1.) ASK

*During this phase my goal is to define the problem and make sure that I fully understand the stakeholder expectations.*

### About the Company

in the system anytime.
